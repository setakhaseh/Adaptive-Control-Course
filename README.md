# Adaptive Control — Course Projects & Exam

This repository contains my coursework, final take-home exam, and final project from the **Adaptive Control** course. The materials showcase key concepts in adaptive control, including parameter estimation, MRAC design, and Lyapunov-based stability proofs.

##  Description

###  Final Take-home Exam
The final exam includes analytical derivations and simulation-based verification of adaptive control principles, covering topics such as:
- Lyapunov stability proofs
- Adaptive law derivations
- Simulation of parameter convergence

###  Final Project
The final project implements a **Model Reference Adaptive Controller (MRAC)** for a nonlinear dynamic system. The controller adjusts parameters online to track a desired reference model in the presence of model uncertainties and disturbances.

**Key features:**
- Adaptive parameter estimation  
- Lyapunov-based stability assurance  
- MATLAB/Python simulation of dynamic response  
- Performance comparison with non-adaptive controllers
