##  Overview
The exam involves the **design, analysis, and simulation** of adaptive control methods for a **planar cable-driven parallel robot**.  
It tests theoretical understanding and practical implementation of adaptive systems under nonlinear dynamics, parameter uncertainty, and external disturbances.

All explanations, derivations, and plots are provided in the **Farsi report**.

##  Topics Covered
1. Adaptive parameter identification (algebraic and first-order dynamic estimators)  
2. State-feedback Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC)  
3. Nonlinear system identification for the cable-driven robot  
4. MRAC design for nonlinear dynamics  
5. Adaptive observer–based parameter estimation  
6. Output-feedback MRAC design  
7. Robust adaptive control under bounded disturbances

##  Notes
- The **report (`report_fa.pdf`) is in Farsi**, containing the main analytical work, equations, and simulation outcomes.  
- The project is based on a **3-DOF planar cable-driven parallel robot**, modeled and controlled adaptively.
